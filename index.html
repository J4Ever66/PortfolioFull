		<p class="intro flex-item">Welcome, my name is Jordan Everard and I will be your host. Currently, I am a senior at Eastern Washington University studying for a Bachelor of Computer Science along with a Visual Communication Design minor. If automotive experts are called gear heads, then you might as well refer to me as a hardware head. At the age of three I was introduced to a computer, we have been together ever since. In my junior year of high school, I enrolled in the Running Start program and began thinking about what I wanted to do with my life. I decided to try out Computer Science because I thought I knew a lot about computers. I was blown away with how unique the content was and how little I actually knew about computers. At first, I struggled to understand the importance of what I was learning. Yet, after some time I began to understand how and why software evolved into what it is today. I seek a bright and adventurous career in the Computer Science industry, striving to gain the skills to become an expert in programming. While there are many ways to do almost anything in this field, I yearn to learn the best practice for an elegant and efficient solution. My current language skill set includes Java, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, C, PHP, MySQL and C++. I enjoy designing unique websites such as this Drupal powered theme, creating electronic music and writing software that manipulates massive amounts of data because it makes the hair on my skin raise whenever I see a computer process millions of items in a matter of seconds.</p>
