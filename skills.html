		<h1>Skills</h1>

		<p>I enjoy diving into any subject that interests me. A perfectionist is what some might call it. Yet, it seems there is not enough time in the world to learn all of the things that I want. The last few years I have been focusing my attention to Computer Science and the many sub-fields contained within.</p>




		<h2>Web Development</h2>

			<h3>HTML5</h3>
			<p>The model. Content. HTML is responsible for placing elements and assigning related attributes. By keeping consistent and minimal naming conventions, we are able to reapply certain attributes to specified elements. With HTML5, many new goodies have been provided that previously required Javascript to function. Videos, iframes, ...</p>

		<h3>CSS</h3>
		<p>The view. Specifying an elements dimensions, aesthetics and basic behavior. Using keyframes, animations have never been easier. </p>

		<h3>Javascript</h3>
		<p>The controller. Dynamic data and behavior. Javascript is a rich environment for calculating, manipulating and </p>

		<h2>Software Engineering</h2>
		<p>The possibilities are endless whilst using Object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C# or C++. The idea that one can create hypothetically anything virtually, repeatedly blows my mind. I often imagine a skyscraper being a large program, all of the pieces are extremely crucial for the building to function properly. While developing any program, it is important to think deeply and remain agile. Being able to add onto any given functionality is both flexible and necessary to maintain it. Even a program that satisfies all of the requirements it was intended to do, might need to be completely restarted to accomodate for upcoming needs. Software development is by far, one of the most misunderstood tasks of today.</p>

		<h3>Java</h3>
		<p>
			The Java Virtual Machine has done wonders over the years. A programming language that can run on any chip, so long as it can handle the JVM. Billions of devices use Java everyday. From our microwaves, to our street lights. Java paved the way for the idea of writing code once and running it everywhere. 
		</p>

		<h3>C#</h3>
		<p>
			C# has been a glorious experience. 
		</p>
		<h3>C++</h3>
		<p>While the syntax can be a bit funky at times, C++ was the first object oriented language. Released in 1998, it has become a reliable and standard language for games, robotics and systems.</p>
